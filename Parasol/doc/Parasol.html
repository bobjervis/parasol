<h1>Parasol Language</h1>
<p>
Parasol (<i><b>Para</b></i>llel <i><b>S</b></i>ystems <i><b>O</b></i>bject <i><b>L</b></i>anguage) is a language designed to create complex parallel and distributed applications.
It was originally created in the early 1990's.
It has been re-designed from the ground up starting in 2011 to incorporate developments in language technology that have become standard features since then.
<p>
Large scale, distributed applications are far more commonplace today and many of the algorithms in use today did not exist when Parasol was originally created.
The Internet has emerged as the platform of choice for networking large numbers of machines together.
