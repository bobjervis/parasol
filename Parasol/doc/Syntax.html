<h1>Parasol Language Syntax</h1>
<h2>Tokenization</h2>
Parasol programs are created as text files.
The Parasol compiler processes these files in two stages: tokenization and parsing.
These stages are completed before any semantic analysis of the parsed text is begun.
<p>
Parasol was designed to follow the syntactic conventions of many other languages, in order to make Parasol code easier to read.
In the original design, most expressions read exactly as they would in C or C++, and since Parasol's creation, Java and javaScript along with other languages have followed similar patterns.
Parasol did deviate significantly in declaration syntax, which proved to be a barrier for some.
<p>
In this version of the language, every effort has been made to keep basic declaration syntax as compatible with C, C++ and Java as possible.
One aspect of the original Parasol language is retained however: type names are always normal symbols like any other and you can declare symbols with names like <b>int</b> without causing an immediate compilation error.
In order to preserve this aspect of Parasol, small restrictions had to be put into the language syntax.
<p>
For example, white space is significant in more places than in Java or C.
In every case, widespread coding standards for C and Java mandate white space in exactly the same locations as Parasol requires.
As a result, programmer's accustomed to conforming to coding styles should not see much of an impediment.
