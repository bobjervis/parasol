<h2>{@level 2 Ttranslation Environment}</h2>
A Parasol program operates within a computing environment called its arena.
It is built as a collection of units injected over time into the arena.
A unit corresponds to one source file or string value.
Each unit contains definitions for objects, functions, types and constants.
Parasol source files can be compiled into library units, or directly into programs.
All of the units that are part of a library or program are called a project.
