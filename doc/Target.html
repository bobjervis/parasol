<h1>Runtime Targets</h1>

Parasol runtime <i>Targets</i> specify a particular execution environment.
In general, Parasol programs do not use conditionally compiled code to be customized for a particular machine platform.
Instead, they use runtime checks to decide which set of logic to invoke, if there is any need. 
<p>
The Parasol compilation environment is designed to support the creation of portable applications.
The preferred method of program deployment is in the form of source code.
The compiler is invoked at run time without a separate compilation step.
<p>
For very large programs or for commercial applications where source is either impractical or undesirable, the compiler can generate binary images that can, in tunr, be run.
