<title>Parasol Language Reference Documentation</title>

<body>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Parasol Language was originally created by Bob Jervis in 1990.
It was a research language designed to create distributed and parallel applications.
The ALYS operating system was written in Parasol and was a full 32-bit multi-tasking kernel.
It made extensive use of messages to communicate between services, exploiting Parasol's RPC feature. 
<p>
Rapidly changing technology in the mid 1990's stranded ALYS and work on Parasol was suspended.
<p>
In December, 2011, Bob resumed work on a parallel programming language and re-designed Parasol from the ground up.
At the end of May, 2015 he completed work on a self-hosted 64-bit native compiler running on Windows 7.
This was deployed as version 0.1, essentially an early alpha copy of the project.
The language has almost no parallel programming features in this release.
The goal of the release was to create a performant self-hosted compiler so that features could be directly developed in Parasol itself.
<p>
The next phase of development will take place more publicly, and interested developers are invited to participate.
As yet, no project plan exists, nor any process for creating one.
<p>
Documentation is obviously almost non-existent as well, so expect to see more of that over time.
